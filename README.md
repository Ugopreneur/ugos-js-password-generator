## Overview

The goal was to try and apply my newly learned Javascript skills (Iterating over arrays, writing for loops, working with different variable scopes, nested loops and nested functions, prompts, if/else statements, methods and more) in developing a simple password generator for use in a real-world situation. 

Hence, I built a web page that, first, asks the use a few password building options, then takes the user's choices and generates a password that fits the user's requirememnts - with all logic written completely in javascript.
